This algorithm, written in Lisp, simulates a combat scenario using predefined combatant statistics and a set of rules. The combat statistics, such as strikes, takedowns, and success percentages, are stored in associative lists. The program defines rules in the baseDeRegles list, which compare combatants' statistics to determine advantages in specific areas (e.g., strikes, takedowns). The rules are sequentially applied for each round, and if a combatant has an advantage in a specific domain, they win the round, and their score is incremented. The program displays the combat's progress round by round, indicating the winning combatant of each round. Finally, it shows the overall result, indicating which combatant won the entire match based on their cumulative round scores.
